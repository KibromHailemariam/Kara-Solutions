# Task 1: Understanding Credit Risk

## Project Overview
This document outlines the objectives and deliverables for Task 1 of the AI Mastery Course focused on understanding the concept of credit risk for Bati Bank's buy-now-pay-later initiative.

## Objective
The primary goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of credit risk, including its definitions, implications, and management strategies within the banking sector.

## Key Concepts

### Credit Scoring
- **Definition:** A method to assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers by assigning a numerical score based on their financial behavior.
- **Purpose:** To predict the likelihood of default.

### Default
- **Definition:** When a borrower fails to repay a loan according to the agreed terms.
- **Contextual Variation:** Definitions can vary but must comply with financial regulations like Basel II.

### Basel II Capital Accord
- **Overview:** A framework for banking supervision which emphasizes capital adequacy, supervisory review, and market discipline.
- **Pillars:**
  - Pillar 1: Minimum Capital Requirements
  - Pillar 2: Supervisory Review Process
  - Pillar 3: Market Discipline

## Business Implications

### Risk Management
- Enables banks to mitigate losses by identifying high-risk customers early.

### Customer Segmentation
- Allows for tailored credit offerings based on assessed risk, enhancing customer satisfaction and profitability.

### Regulatory Compliance
- Ensures that credit scoring practices are in line with international standards, reducing legal risks.

### Profitability
- Helps in pricing credit products appropriately to balance risk and return.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Conceptual Understanding:** Grasp the foundational concepts of credit risk.
- **Regulatory Awareness:** Recognize the importance of regulatory frameworks like Basel II in credit practices.
- **Strategic Application:** Apply theoretical knowledge to practical business scenarios, particularly in product development for credit services.

## Task Deliverables

- **Report:** A detailed report or notebook documenting the study of credit risk concepts, regulatory frameworks, and their business impacts.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Located in `./notebooks/`, these will include:
  - Exploratory data analysis related to credit risk if applicable.
  - Code examples or visualizations to illustrate concepts.
